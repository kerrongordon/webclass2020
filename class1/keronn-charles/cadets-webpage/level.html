                <p>All of the subjects below are taught by trained Instructors and Senior Cadets as standards of training are important in any youth organization such as ours.</p>
                
                <p>The training system works along the principles of theory and practice. Many opportunities present themselves at weekend and longer camps, where cadets are 
                    able to put their newly taught skills into practice.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drill, Turn out and Military Knowledge:</li>

                    <p>Through Foot Drill cadets are thought the importance of obedience and discipline as well as learning how to work together as a team. Whether it be on
                        parade square or moving around the barracks, it's important to be able to move large numbers of people from point to point whilst making sure they 
                        look smart. Through Military Knowledge, cadets learn about the structure of the Grenada Cadet Corps.</p>

                    <li>Skill At Arms:</li>

                    <p>Cadets learn to be disciplined and safe when handling weapons and no firing off weapons is permitted until Cadets have demonstrated these skills. Once a
                         Cadet has demonstrated his or her ability to control a weapon safely and with discipline, they are given the opportunity to practice their skills
                          on a range.</p>

                    <li>Map and Compasses:</li>

                    <p>Cadets learn to navigate safely from point to point using a map and a compass. This is often taught from a military perspective with the Cadets 
                        having the opportunity to practice their skills in orienteering exercises</p>

                    <li>Field Craft:</li>

                    <p>Field Craft is a term used to describe the basic military skills requried to operatre  stealthily at day or night regardless of weather or terrain.
                         The motto of Field Craft is "to see without being seen"; this is upheld through the skills learned in Field Craft lessons.</p>

                    <p>Cadets learn how to look after themselves when away from comforts of home as well as the basics of military tactics. Field Craft gives Cadets the 
                        opportunity to practice their leadership and teamwork skills.</p>

                    <li>Adventure Training:</li>

                    <p>Adventure Training allows cadets to praqctice camp craft while at the same time developing stamina, discipline, initiative and self-reliance by
                         means of an expedition involving a minimum of 15 miles on foot and one night.</p>

                    <li>Leadership Training:</li>

                    <p>The art of leadership, followed closely by the skills of management, are perhaps the most valuable aspects of the experience as a cadet, and the 
                        most relevant to adult life. The opportuinty to command, manage, and lead other people in the number of a section, a platoon, or a company, 
                        prepares the cadet for positions of responsibility in future careers.</p>

                    <li>Citizenship Training- The Cadet and the Community:</li>

                    <p>No youth movement would be complete without it supporting the community in many local activities. The aim is to introduce the cadet to his/her 
                        responsibilities as a citizen and to develop in him/her a constructive attitude to life at home and in detachment so that he/she participates fully 
                        in the life of the detachment. Cadets assist in many events and projects at A
                        National and Community level.</p>
