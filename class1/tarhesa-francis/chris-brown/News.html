        <p>Charges of felony battery against US singer Chris Brown have been dropped, one year after he was arrested after a concert in West Plam Beach, Florida. 

        The incident involved an alleged attack at a nightclub in Tampa in 2017.<br>
        Brown was accused of punching the club's photographer, who was reportedly taking pictures of him after being told not to. 

        <h1> Chris Brown Streams His Way to No.1 With 'Indigo' </h1>
        <h3> The R&B singer's 32-track album featuring a collaboration with Drake beat out a new release by the Black Keys, which opened at No.4.
        The R&B singer Chris Brown reached No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week with his new release, “Indigo,” while the rock band the Black Keys opened at No. 4 with their first album in five years, “Let’s Rock.”</h3>

        <p>“Indigo” (RCA) opened at the top with the equivalent of 108,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen.</br> 
        Like many artists these days, Brown offered copies of his album as part of sales bundles with concert tickets and merchandise, but the success of his album came largely from streaming. His total sales number, as computed by Billboard and Nielsen, includes 98 million streams and just 28,000 copies sold as a full album.</br> 
        (His streaming number may have been helped by the fact that the album contains 32 songs.)
                
        While to much of the wider public Brown remains tainted by his arrest in 2009 for assaulting Rihanna — he was sentenced to five years’ probation and community service for that offense — Brown has remained consistently popular, particularly among R&B and hip-hop fans.</br> 
        His first two No. 1 albums — “F.A.M.E.” and “Fortune” — came in the years after that arrest, and his singles have frequently dotted the Top 10; “No Guidance,” a track from “Indigo” that features Drake, went to No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 5 on the R&B chart.
                
        Also on the chart this week, Lil Nas X’s debut EP, “7,” holds at No. 2, while Billie Eilish is No. 3 with “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?”</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Chris Brown is the next musical artist to jump into the fashion world. </h1>
          All morning, Chris Brown has been posting photos to his Instagram account using the hashtag #BlackPyramid, the name of his new clothing label. The label has been seen on celebrities here and there (Rihanna has been seen wearing it), but now it looks like they are gearing up for a larger release.
          The clothing itself is streetwear with a focus on flipping popular sports logos, jerseys and apparel with the label’s own style. There are brightly colored bombers, tees, vintage-looking polos, track pants and racing jackets. The shirts all use the popular elongated cut with split and curved hems, making the style very in-the-moment and rockable.
          The brand has used Chris Brown Entertainment’s Mechanical Dummy as a jumping off point. The lifestyle and culture website opened a shop in Virginia, where the Black Pyramid clothing label has been sold.
          It looks like the full collection will be available soon via the Mechanical Dummy web store, although no official release date has been posted. At the very least, the clothes will be reasonably priced – Chris Brown tweeted that his “clothes are for the people. Affordable…” Are there any pieces in particular y’all are feeling, or should Chris Breezy stick to the studio?
