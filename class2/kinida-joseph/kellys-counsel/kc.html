        <h2>ADVICE</h2>
        <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>

        <p>
          <h1>Life Advice</h1>
          <ol>
The first kind of counsel for your consideration: words of wisdom for almost any life situation.

<li>“You’ve never seen a cat skeleton in a tree, have you?” When Alexandra Aulisi’s cat couldn’t get down from a tree, her grandmother reassured her with those words, predicting (correctly) that the cat would come down on his own. “This advice made me realize that, sometimes, you need to shift your perception of a problem to see a solution,” Ms. Aulisi noted.</li>

<li>“Don’t pickle things.” That line, brought to you by reader Sam Singer’s mother, means: If you have something special, use it now. “Serve daily meals on your good china. Wash your hands with the luxurious soap you received as a housewarming gift. Drink that bottle of amazing wine right away. Don’t save things for future use — because who knows what the future looks like?”</li>

<li>“Exercise adds 20 degrees.” For example, “if it’s 28 degrees out and it seems too cold to go running,” Rory Evans wrote, “once you get moving, it’ll feel like it’s 48 degrees. And that, you can handle.”</li>

<li>“Touch it once.” According to Christine H., this household hint involves putting something away the first time you pick it up. That way, “you don’t have to waste energy looking at it (and feeling guilty), or letting it get dusty so you have to clean it before putting it away.”</li>

<li>“Sleep on his side of the bed.” Mattie Scott heard this advice at her husband’s funeral. “It’s truly the best piece of advice I’ve ever gotten,” she notes. “The effect was profoundly comforting, and it greatly lessened the ache of missing his physical presence.”</li>

<li>“Things don’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.” Gail Dekker first heard her friend, a wedding coordinator, offer these words to young couples whose emotions were running high. But it works in all kinds of situations, including Ms. Dekker’s house hunt. “My initial reaction was that there was something wrong with every condo I saw. My friend reminded me: A place didn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful. She was right.”</li>

<li>“Take a breath.” Melissa Fanning heard this from a yoga teacher (“at a corporate retreat about which I remember nothing else”). It wasn’t a yoga instruction; it was a suggestion to pause at stressful moments, to avoid saying or doing something regrettable. “I use this advice every day,” Ms. Fanning wrote. “It has preserved peace, calmed me, and made me appear smarter than I am.”</li>

        <h2>GREAT ADVICE</h2>
        <h5>Advice that we sometimes take for granted, Sep 2, 2020</h5>
        <img src="advice1.png">
        <div class="advice1" style="height:200px;"></div>
        <p>1. Take time to know yourself. "Know thyself" said Aristotle. When you know who you are, you can be wise about your goals, your dreams, your standards, your convictions. Knowing who you are allows you to live your life with purpose and meaning.<BR><BR>

          2. A narrow focus brings big results. The number one reason people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they have come. But it's a series of small wins that can give us the most significant success.<BR><BR>
          
          3. Show up fully. Don't dwell on the past, and don't daydream about the future, but concentrate on showing up fully in the present moment.<BR><BR>
          
          4. Don't make assumptions. If you don't know the situation fully, you can't offer an informed opinion.<BR><BR>
          
          5. Be patient and persistent. Life is not so much what you accomplish as what you overcome. <BR><BR>
          
          6. In order to get, you have to give. If you support, guide, and lead others, if you make contributions to their lives, you will reap the best rewards.<BR><BR>
          
          7. Luck comes from hard work. Luck happens when hard work and timing and talent intersect.<BR><BR>
          
          8. Be your best at all times. You never know what the future will bring, so always make the best use of the present.<BR><BR>
          
          9. Don't try to impress everyone. The unhappiest people are those who care the most about what other people think.<BR><BR>
          
          10. Don't be afraid of being afraid. Sometimes the one thing you need for growth is the one thing you are most afraid to do.<BR><BR>
          
          11.  Listen to learn. Learn how to listen. You can't learn anything when you're talking.<br><BR>
          
          Sometimes we get excellent advice but we forget to take it in. Take it in and pass it on.</p>
